Refactor:
Top down
    Pages should only have components and layout structs , logic seperated
    Add proptypes to subcomponents
    If a component is modular (pass props) make it a new component
    re-names to be more precise
        shiparchive
        shipdetail
        ^^^ we'll keep them seperate for dev reasons
    refactor asset code
    
features broken:
    selecting skins in ship resume does not work:
        default 'background' should not appear at all; is for secretary modes

qol looking foward to:
    fix search/archives background
        research proper image backgrounding from outside code
    force skill icons to be consistent size
    make gallery popup into a modal (with 'view full image' as a url option)
    make 'meta' dev tab not be really big
    
new major features:
    fill in 'more info' about ships
    ship filter tabs
    remove banners from deployed version

code:
    sys libs at Top
    \n newline
    hooks / asssets
    \n newline
    components
